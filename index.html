				<p style="width:80vw;">&emsp;I am a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics student at the University of Delaware. Going into my sophomore year, I am excited for the new opportunities that will come my way. I've always loved computers, and for the past 3 years programming has been my outlet. With school, personal projects, Leetcode, and a research position at Delaware State University, Iâ€™ve immersed myself in the world of computer science. The heart of my professional interests involve seeing real outcomes from my programming, whether that be in machinery or a fine-tuned neural network.</p>

                        Block Smash is a grid-based puzzle game where players strategically place blocks to complete and smash rows or columns, earning points and clearing space. The project integrates JavaScript and Python, showcasing its primary purpose: the development of Smash-Bot, an AI powered by a neural network that plays the game to achieve high scores. Through this project, I solidified my knowledge of JavaScript and Python while gaining experience in medium-sized projects, front/back-end programming, and machine learning.

                        Weigh Scale is an arcade-style game where players slice flying fruit to drop their "weight" onto a scale. The game features two modes: Normal, where players aim to slice fruit before they escape the screen, and Bug, where only fruit should be sliced to gain weight, avoiding penalties for cutting bugs. This was the final project for my Intro to Computer Science course, designed to show my expertise with simple Python.

                        Monkey Game is a TypeScript-based project featuring two mini-games to test your memory and reaction time. Developed as the final project for my Intro to Computer Science II class, this project was pivotal in advancing my understanding of TypeScript and implementing interactive game mechanics. It allowed me to apply theoretical concepts in a practical, creative way while working with an instructor-provided library, strengthening my problem-solving and programming skills.
